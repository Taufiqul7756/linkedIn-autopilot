# PRD — LinkedIn Autopilot Page

## Overview

A single-page dashboard that lets users generate on-brand LinkedIn posts from their website, review and approve drafts, schedule, and auto-publish — all orchestrated by a multi-agent AI workflow.

## Problem

Marketing and GTM teams struggle to maintain a consistent LinkedIn presence. Writing posts manually is time-consuming, tone is inconsistent, and scheduling is ad-hoc.

## Goal

Give users a fully automated LinkedIn content pipeline with a single human approval gate — so they stay in control without doing the manual work.
