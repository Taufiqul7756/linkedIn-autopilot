# PRD — LinkedIn Autopilot Page

## Overview

A single-page dashboard that lets users generate on-brand LinkedIn posts from their website, review and approve drafts, schedule, and auto-publish — all orchestrated by a multi-agent AI workflow.

## Problem

Marketing and GTM teams struggle to maintain a consistent LinkedIn presence. Writing posts manually is time-consuming, tone is inconsistent, and scheduling is ad-hoc.

## Goal

Give users a fully automated LinkedIn content pipeline with a single human approval gate — so they stay in control without doing the manual work.

## Sections

### 1. Page Header
- Title: "LinkedIn Autopilot" with LinkedIn icon
- Subtitle: "Generate on-brand posts from your website, approve, schedule, and auto-publish."
- No header action buttons

### 2. Account & Knowledge Base
- **LinkedIn account card**: Shows connection status (Connected/Disconnected), authorized user, OAuth scope.
  - Action: **Manage** → opens LinkedInManageModal (current account info + "Connect your LinkedIn" button + disconnect link)
- **Website knowledge base card**: Shows crawl status (Ready/Stale), domain, facet count.
  - Action: **Add sources** → opens AddUrlModal: add new URL + list existing indexed URLs with status dot + delete per URL (`DELETE /websites/{id}/`)
  - Action: **Add to Knowledge Base** → opens KnowledgeBaseUploadModal: drag-and-drop PDF upload + list of uploaded docs with status + delete per doc (`DELETE /documents/{id}/`)
  - Action: **Re-crawl** → triggers re-index of website
- **Stats grid** (2 rows × 4 cards, real API): Row 1 — Drafts · Approved · Scheduled · Published; Row 2 — Failed · Published This Week · Next Scheduled · Avg. Engagement
  - API: `GET /api/v1/content/posts/stats/`
  - Response fields: `drafts`, `approved`, `scheduled`, `published`, `failed`, `published_this_week`, `next_scheduled_at` (ISO), `avg_engagement`
  - `next_scheduled_at` displayed as relative time ("in 2h 40m")
  - `avg_engagement` displayed as percentage with 1 decimal

### 3. Generate Posts from Knowledge Base
- Controls: Number of posts (3/5/10), Tone (dropdown), Length (Short/Medium/Long), Content Style (dropdown)
- Optional custom prompt textarea with placeholder
- "Suggest prompts" button → `POST /content/posts/suggest_prompts/` with `website_profile` UUID → shows clickable suggestion chips; clicking a chip fills the prompt textarea
- Footer note: posts stay as drafts until approved
- Primary action: Generate → `POST /content/posts/generate/` with `{ website_profile, documents, prompt, tone, length, content_style, count }`; both buttons disabled if no website connected
- Card has a gradient background: blue-gray (`#ECEEF8`) → white (top to bottom)

### 4. Review & Approval
- Shows drafts awaiting review (badge count)
- Polls every 5s after Generate fires (via `["posts-generating"]` React Query cache flag); stops when posts arrive
- Generating spinner shown while polling and no posts yet
- Two-column card grid, each card showing:
  - Author avatar (initials from LinkedIn account name), Draft badge
  - Post body text (whitespace-pre-line) + optional image
  - Hashtags (prefixed with `#`)
  - **Edit** → EditPostModal
  - **Regenerate Post** → RegeneratePostConfirmModal ("your current version will be lost") → (future API)
  - **Regenerate Image** → toggles an image prompt textarea panel below the card buttons; panel has a "Generate Image" button (disabled until API wired up)
  - **Delete** → DeleteConfirmModal → `DELETE /content/posts/{id}/`
  - **Approve** → `POST /content/posts/{id}/approve/`
- No "View all drafts" link
- APIs: `GET /content/posts/?status=draft`, `POST /approve/`, `DELETE`

### 5. Post Management
- Excludes draft posts server-side via `exclude_status=draft` query param (drafts live in Review & Approval only)
- Table with checkbox selection + select-all (indeterminate state)
- **Bulk delete** appears when ≥ 2 rows selected
- **Page size selector** (2 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 per page, default 10) — passed as `page_size` to API
- **Filter** dropdown: All / Approved / Scheduled / Published / Failed (no Draft option)
- Pagination bar always visible at bottom (Previous / Next, page X · N total)
- Columns: ☐ · POST · CREATED · SCHEDULED · PUBLISHED · STATUS · ENGAGEMENT · ACTIONS
- Status pills: Approved (emerald) · Scheduled (blue) · Published (green) · Failed (red)
- Engagement cell: Published → impressions/likes/comments/rate%; Scheduled → "In queue"; Approved → "Ready"; Failed → "Publishing failed"
- Per-row actions based on status:
  - Approved → **Schedule** → ScheduleModal → `POST /content/posts/{id}/schedule/`
  - Scheduled → **Reschedule** → ScheduleModal (reschedule mode, shows current) + ▶ play button
  - Failed → **Retry**
  - Published → **External link** icon (opens LinkedIn post)
- Three-dot dropdown per row: **View** → ViewPostModal · **Delete** → DeleteConfirmModal → `DELETE /content/posts/{id}/`
- APIs: `GET /content/posts/?page_size=N&page=N&status=X&exclude_status=draft`, `POST /schedule/`, `DELETE`

### 6. Autopilot Agent Workflow
- Live status indicator
- Orchestrator banner: coordinating status, agents active, posts in flight, gate needs-you count
- 7 agent cards in a 4+3 grid:
  - Connector Agent (OAuth & tokens) — Connected
  - Knowledge Agent (crawls site, builds KB) — Working
  - Generator Agent (drafts posts from KB) — Working
  - Review Gate (human approval) — Needs you
  - Scheduler Agent (queue & timezone) — Working
  - Publisher Agent (auto-publish, retry, log) — Working
  - Analytics Agent (pulls post metrics) — Working
