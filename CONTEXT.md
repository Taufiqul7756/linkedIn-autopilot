## Business Rules

- Posts are generated as drafts and will not publish until approved
- Human approval is required at the Review Gate before scheduling
- The Autopilot runs 7 agents: Connector, Knowledge, Generator, Review Gate, Scheduler, Publisher, Analytics
- Bulk delete requires selecting at least 2 posts
- Run Agent is available when at least 1 post is selected
- Deleting a post permanently removes it; always requires confirmation via DeleteConfirmModal (used in both Review & Approval and Post Management)

## Status Flows

```
[Draft] → [Approved] → [Scheduled] → [Published]
                                   ↘ [Failed]
```
